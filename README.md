# allele-specific-circRNA_V2
This pipline is used to identify allele-specific circRNAs within individual.

1. The preparation required to identify allele-specific circRNAs is in 01_Preparatory_work.sh.
2. Allele_specific_circRNA.all_process.sh contains 02_circRNA_annotation.sh, 03_remapping_and_filter.sh and 04_allele_specific_circRNA.sh.
3. Using this pipeline only requires modifying the the path of data, software, and the results.
4. The specific steps and annotation are in 02_circRNA_annotation.sh, 03_remapping_and_filter.sh and 04_allele_specific_circRNA.sh
