# allele-specific-circRNA_V2
This pipline is used to identify allele-specific circular Rnas within individual

The preparation required to identify allele-specific circular Rnas is in 01_Preparatory_work.sh
allele_specific_circRNA.all_process.sh contains 02_circRNA_annotation.sh, 03_remapping_and_filter.sh and 04_allele_specific_circRNA.sh
Using these files only requires modifying the the path of data, software, and the results
